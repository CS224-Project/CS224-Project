\section{Data and Methodology}

\subsection{Data Overview}

Our primary source of data was aggregated by James Fowler \textbf{CITATION}.
Fowler developed several disjoint of House and Senate social networks for the
$93^{rd}$ through the $110^{th}$ Congress. His data contains the names and
Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) Ids for all
legislators for each congress, as well as an indicator matrix of which
legislator was a sponsor of a bill and which legislator was a cosponsor of a
bill. With this, we know who sponsored and cosponsored each bills, and thus, 
which legislators each indivdiual Congressman cosponsored a bill with.

We supplement this data with additional information for each legislator, 
including ideology scores provided by DW Nominate \textbf{CITATION}, party, 
age, sex, and region of the United States. Data sources include DW Nominate, 
GovTrack, and \textbf{BLAH}.

\subsection{Constructing the Network}

The questions we are primarily concerned about answering in this paper relate 
to how can we model working and collaborative relationships with legislators. 
We want to achieve this by creating a network between legislators where a 
connection represents a collaborative working relationship. We have a number of 
options to construct the network. We ultimately chose to define a working 
relationship between Congressman $A$ and $B$ if they meet the following 
conditions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item In total there exists at least $5$ cosponsorships between $A$ and $B$ 
	on which either $A$ or $B$ was the primary sponsor.
	\item $A$ needs to cosponsor at least one of $B$'s bills and vice versa.
\end{itemize}

We discuss our choice of this network over others in the following sections.

\textbf{Cosponsorship Versus Role Call Votes}

We can infer that a cosponsorship is almost equivalent to voting for a bill. If 
you are willing to cosponsor a bill then you will most likely vote for the bill. 
We decided against using roll call votes as our measure of collaboration for 
the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cosponsorship contains support signaling. It is a method legislators 
	use to signal to the rest of Congress that they support a bill.
	\item Voting for a bill does not necessarily imply a collaborative working 
	relationship. There are reasons to vote for a bill that goes beyond a 
	working relationship, including voting for a partisan issue or voting for 
	an issue that affects your constituents.
\end{itemize}

In short, we believe that embedded in roll call votes there is a signal of a 
working relationship, but we believe that the signal is obscured by noise 
relating to other voting reasons.

\textbf{Why 5 Mutual Cosponsorships}

We believe that there is a stronger signal in mutual cosponsorships. We believe, 
however, that without some thresholding on the number of cosponsorships, we may 
get too noisy of a signal for working relationships. We think that consistent 
cosponsorships support between legislators is the best way to smooth out and 
detect working relationships.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Either $A$ voted for a bill sponsored by $B$ or vice versa.
	\item Either $A$ cosponsored a bill sponsored by $B$ or vice versa.


threshold k = 5 shared cosponsorships condition that must be at least one 
cosponsorship in 1 direction.

With this data, we constructed a bipartite graph between legislators and
bills, where an edge represents a legislator either sponsoring or cosponsoring
the bill. We keep note of which legislator was the main sponsor of a bill. We 
collapse the bipartite graph  We can then collapse this bipartite graph on the bills and effectively
create a network of legislators where an edge between legislator $A$ and $B$
represents that either $A$ cosponsored one of $B$'s bills, or vice versa, or
they both cosponsored each other's bills.
