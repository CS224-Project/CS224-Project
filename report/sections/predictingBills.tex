\section{Bill Passage}

The web of working relationships in Congress is also interesting because of the
effect it may have on legislative outcomes. A basic model of legislation, along
the lines of the Median Voter Theorem~\cite{Black}, would say that legislation
is most likely to pass if its ideological content matches most closely the
median ideology of legislators. A more sophisticated take would include the
effects of party such as the level of support by the majority party and party
leaders, who can exert control on which amendments or bills will come up for a
vote.

But there are several reasons to believe that there are factors beyond just
party and ideology (as defined by DW-NOMINATE) that would determine the success
of a piece of legislation. For one, relatively few bills are passed relative the
the amount introduced, so there is the question of which bills will be
prioritized. Additionally, bills are often technical in nature without a major
ideological component or are compromises between various factions. Finally,
bills themselves might be subjects of larger compromises, in which legislators
vote for each others' bills in what is known as `logrolling'~\cite{Schwartz}.

Each of these factors can be influenced by considering the network of working
relationships. Congresspeople with more numerous, important, and strategic
relationships may be more likely to get the bills they write or cosponsor
passed, even holding fixed party and ideology variables.

In many ways, this is similar to the question of community growth in the network
literature. The success of a bill is analagous to the spreading of the early
community formed by the early cosponsors to cover a majority of Congress.
Backstrom et al.~\cite{Backstrom} identify several features of early networks
that they see as important for growth. In particular, they find a lot of
significance in the number of nodes that have edges to someone in the early
network, which they call the `fringe'. Additionally, they look at features
related to clustering in the early network, such as the ratio of closed to open
triads which is negatively correlated with growth. Finally, they look at the
`activity' of the initial group, which in our context might include the
legislative productivity of the early cosponsor networks.

\subsection{Features}

We split our feature set into \textit{demographic} features, \textit{visibility}
features, and \textit{network} features over the early cosponsorship network. In
the case where a bill does not have any cosponsors, the features are computed
for the sponsor alone. To focus on the main backers and supporters of a bill and
to avoid including cosponsors who join onto a bill when it looks like it will
pass, we limit the pool of considered cosponsors to only those who sign on in
the first 30 days after the bill was introduced.

The demographic features most prominently include party and ideology, and
include age, gender, and region as well. These features are meant to capture the
palatability of the bill to various factions. If a bill's chance of success
really does depend primarily on its content, we would expect these demographic
variables to be the important ones. In particular, we consider
\begin{itemize}
	\item whether sponsor is from majority party
	\item party impurity of early cosponsors
	\item ideology of sponsor
	\item mean ideology of early cosponsors
	\item variance of ideology of early cosponsors
	\item regional diversity of early cosponsors
	\item gender impurity of early cosponsors
	\item variance in age of early cosponsors
\end{itemize}

The visibility features are meant to capture how prominent or well-known a
legislator is in Congress. In some ways, these can be thought of as a poor man's
version of the network features, which explicitly capture how embedded a
legislator is in the Congressional network. The idea is that more visible
legislators will have greater success in attracting support for their
initiatives. All variables that are computed in `real time' are measured as of
the first of the month after the bill was sponsored to reflect the state of the
world after the initial cosponsorship network was formed. Our specific
considered features are
\begin{itemize}
	\item number of terms served by sponsor
	\item whether the sponsor is a chairman or ranking member of a standing committee
	\item number of bills written by sponsor so far
	\item number of bills cosponsored by sponsor so far
	\item number of consponsorships received by sponsor so far
\end{itemize}

Finally, we introduce our network features gleaned directly from the constructed
web of working relationships. We construct the network in `real time' for each
bill, seeding it with the network from the prior Congress and keeping it up to
date as of the bill's date so as to capture recent relationships and the
situation for new Congressmembers. We view these relationships as the
operationalization of the theory mentioned above that more visible legislators
will succeed more often with their bills. Legislators with more useful working
relationships with their peers may be more likely to get their bills prioritized
and passed. It is useful to have more working relationships but it is also
useful if those working relationships are with other influential members of
Congress. Furthermore, it may be better if the early cosponsorship network has a
diverse set of working relationships and don't cluster too tightly among
themselves. These intuitions lead us to the following set of features
\begin{itemize}
	\item degree of sponsor
	\item eigenvector centrality of sponsor
	\item cut size of set of early cosponsors
	\item clustering of early cosponsors
	\item presence of early cosponsors in stable CESNA clusters
\end{itemize}
