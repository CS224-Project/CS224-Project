\subsection{Latent Multi-group Membership Graph Model (Kim and Leskovec, 2012)}

Kim and Leskovec~\cite{Kim} propose a model that explicitly links node features
with network structure. In particular, they develop a two-stage model to
understand this relationship. First, the node features determine which of
several latent groups the node is a part of. Nodes can be a part of multiple
groups and the groups can have overlapping memberships. Second, the extent and
nature of overlapping group membership between the nodes governs the probability
of edge formation between nodes.

The model can be applied to various tasks. The authors document how it achieves
success both in predicting node features and in predicting edge formation.
Additionally, the intermediate step of group classification allows various types
of clustering analyses to be run - for example, which features correspond to
membership in different groups and how dense the link structures in the
resulting groups are.
