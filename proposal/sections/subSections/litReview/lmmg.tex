\subsection{Kim and Leskovec}

Kim and Leskovec propose a model that explicitly links node features with network structure. In particular, they develop a two-stage model to understand this relationship. First, the node features determine which of several latent groups the node is a part of. Nodes can be a part of multiple groups and the groups can have overlapping memberships. Second, the probability of edges forming derives from the extent and nature of overlapping group membership between the nodes.

The model can be applied to various tasks. The authors document how it achieves success both in predicting node features and in predicting edge formation. Additionally, the intermediate step of group classification allows various types of clustering analyses to be run: for example, which features correspond to membership in different groups and how dense the link structures in the resulting groups are.
