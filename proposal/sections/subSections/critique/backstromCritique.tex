\subsection{Backstrom and Leskovec - Critique}

Link prediction has several possible applications for a network like the one 
we are considering, but on data that is so feature rich it is important to be 
conscious of how the algorithm we use is handling the balance between network 
structure and node/edge features.  The Supervised Random Walks algorithm would
be ideal for this application, as we will be able to account for our node and 
edge features, without requiring costly and time consuming feature engineering. 
In addition to the savings the algorithm provides over a typical supervised
machine learning algorithm, because of the method with which the strength 
function we train in the supervised step is implemented it is compatible with 
any of our combination of categorical and continuous variables, allowing us more
leeway in the subset of features that we select to guide our link prediction.

One thing to keep in mind is that the Supervised Random Walk model is very
sensitive to what an edge means. Given that there are various ways for us to
represent edges (e.g. through cosponsorships, committees, etc.), we have to be
careful in evaluating the edges that the model predicts. That is, if we do not
construct meaningful edges with appropriate edge features, we will get
suboptimal results.
