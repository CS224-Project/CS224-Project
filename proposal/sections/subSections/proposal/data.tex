\subsection{Data}

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
We will be using the data compiled by James Fowler on the $94^{rd}$ through 
$110^{th}$ congress. This data includes the ICPRS id number for each 
representative, their party, state, and the bills that they have cosponsored. 
Further, we have data on when a bill was created, when and if it passed 
committee hearing, and when and if it was passed into law. Further, we have 
ideology scores on all representatives up until the BLAH congress.

We have additional supplementary data on candidates and bills, which is compiled 
by govTrack, which is an entity that scrapes and compiles congressional data 
from congress.gov. Conceivably every feature of a bill, including the 
entirety of the text, what happened to a bill during each stage of the 
bill's life, and who voted for and against a bill, is included in this data.

\noindent
In total, this comprises approximately $1000$ representatives (nodes) and about 
$350000$ bills (potential edges). This amounts to about $500$ Mbs of graph 
data. In additon, the average storage size of the metadata of a bill is 
\textbf{BLAH}.
