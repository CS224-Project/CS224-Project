\subsection{Problem}

We are primarily focused on the state of relationships in congress, how 
they evolved over time, and how those evolutions affected the state of 
legislative outcomes. In particular, we want to investigate what constitutes a 
relationship in congress. Fowler suggested that a relationship is a function 
of who cosponsors bills with a legislator. We believe that this is likely the 
case, but we are interested in using and incorporating other features into 
the graph, such as committee membership. 

Further, beyond legislative working relationship features we are interested in 
determining the main features beyond partisanship that determines cohorts. We 
would like to see if cohort membership identifies similar bill sponsorship and 
voting behavior.

We would also like to determine a method for evaluating the Congressional 
network as it grows and changes overtime. It is commonly thought that Congress 
has become more partisan as time has progressed. We want to see, given our 
relationship metric, if we can see partisanship evolving. Further, we want to 
see if beyond partisanship and legislative working relationship features if 
representatives belong to cohorts.

 Fowler attempted to do this by 
partitioning each Congress and examine centrality features to see if they 
remained static or not. We would like to try to model this network in a 
large graph
