\subsection{Problem}

Partisanship has increased in Congress.

We are primarily focused on the state of relationships in congress, how 
they evolved over time, and how those evolutions affected the state of 
legislative outcomes. In particular, we want to investigate what constitutes a 
relationship in congress. Fowler suggested that a relationship is a function 
of who cosponsors bills with a legislator. We believe that this is likely the 
case, but we are interested in using and incorporating other features into 
the graph, such as committee membership. 

We would also like to determine a method for evaluating the Congressional
network as it grows and changes overtime. It is commonly thought that Congress
has become more partisan as time has progressed. We want to see, given our
relationship metric, if we can see partisanship evolving. Further, we want to
see if beyond partisanship if representatives belong to cohorts. We are 
optimistic that the

Fowler attempted to do this by  partitioning each Congress and examine
centrality features to see if they  remained static or not. We would like to try
to model this network in a  large graph


Further, beyond legislative working relationship features we are interested in 
determining the main features beyond partisanship that determines cohorts. We 
would like to see if cohort membership identifies similar bill sponsorship and 
voting behavior.
